I HIGHLY recommend keeping the Git Repo in your $HOME directory. It's what I've based this off of.

You shouldn't have to change anything except for the WoFi config. I can't get $HOME to work in it, but it doesn't matter.

Once you download it, you can either run the `deploy_dotfiles.sh` and it'll automatically create symlinks to your respective folders in `$HOME/.config/` OR you can also just put the individual folders into their respective places, it'll work either way :)
